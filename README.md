🧬 Overview
This project presents a multimodal machine learning system to diagnose Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using both clinical blood report data and ultrasound images.
By combining structured (tabular) and unstructured (image) data sources, the system aims to improve early detection accuracy using classical machine learning and deep learning approaches.

🚀 Features
🔬 Tabular Diagnosis: Uses features such as BMI, testosterone levels, and follicle counts.

🖼️ Image Diagnosis: CNN model trained on ultrasound images to detect ovarian morphology.

🔗 Multimodal Fusion: A soft fusion technique combines outputs from both models.

🌐 Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit-based frontend allows clinicians to input values and upload images for diagnosis.

📊 Data Sources
Tabular Data: Extracted and partially synthetically augmented from Kaggle datasets (~3000 rows).

Image Data: Ultrasound images categorized into PCOS and Non-PCOS.
